# Digital-Synthesizer--Granular-
This is a digital synthesizer I've created using the ATMEGA32 controller and arduino firmware as a hobby
and learning experience. Pictures, schematics, and code is available in this repository to gain a better understanding
of the details of the project.

This repository stores documentation that can help analyze and/or reproduce this digital synthesizer. The source code
(which I have adapted) and inspiration for this project is based off Peter Knight's work ---> http://tinker.it

Any questions about my rendition of this digital synthesizer can be directed to my github profile or to andreunsal@gmail.com.

Enjoy.
